# Lab 04, Exercise 04: Outlier Detection

**Objective:** Learn how to configure outlier detection in Envoy and how to visualize this pattern and its affects in Grafana.

## Background

## Step 1: Configure outlier ejection for Envoy
## Step 2: Verify in Grafana

  2. Look at the dashboard, now you can see that Envoy is ejecting the broken service from the load balancing
  3. The service time has also reduced as the retry is not as spammy
