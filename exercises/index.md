# Labs for Service Mesh Workshop

## Lab 01: Setup

In this set of exercises you'll get set up with the workshop environment and install the components you'll need for the rest of this workshop.

* [01: Get Familiar with Environment](lab-01/01-get-familiar-with-environment/index.md)
* [02: Install Consul via Helm Chart](lab-01/02-install-consul/index.md)
* [03: Install emojify app](lab-01/03-install-emojify-app/index.md)
* [04: Install Prometheus and Grafana](lab-01/04-install-prometheus-and-grafana/index.md)
* [05: Configure Grafana](lab-01/05-configure-grafana/index.md)

## Lab 02: Security

In this set of exercises you'll enable security features in the service mesh by congiuring Consul Connect sidecar injection and then Consul intentions.

* [01: Enable Connect Sidecar Injection](lab-02/01-enable-connect-inject/index.md)
* [02: Configure Intentions](lab-02/02-configure-intentions/index.md)

## Lab 03: Observability

In this set of exercises you'll enable observability features of the service mesh and build a Grafana dashboard.

* [01: Configure Envoy Statistics](lab-03/01-configure-envoy-statistics/index.md)
* [02: Build Grafana Dashboard](lab-03/02-build-grafana-dashboard/index.md)

## Lab 04: Reliability

In this set of exercises you'll implement four reliability patterns: load balancing, timeouts, retries, and outlier detection (circuit breaking).

* [01: Load Balancing](lab-04/01-load-balancing/index.md)
* [02: Timeouts](lab-04/02-timeouts/index.md)
* [03: Retries](lab-04/03-retries/index.md)
* [04: Outlier Detection](lab-04/04-outlier-detection/index.md)
