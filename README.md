If you are not using Yarn then the same installation should be possible with npm:

```
$ sudo npm install -g https://github.com/nicholasjackson/md2googleslides/releases/download/v0.4.0/md2gslides-0.4.0.tar.gz
/usr/bin/md2gslides -> /usr/lib/node_modules/md2gslides/bin/md2gslides.js
+ md2gslides@0.4.0
updated 1 package in 4.009s
```

Slides can then be built with the following command:

```
$ md2gslides -c 1DMiG8T0W2uQoBe1X9cWMA98eA-4HXb5B-G2si52nbu4 -t "QCon - Security" ./slides/security/security.md
